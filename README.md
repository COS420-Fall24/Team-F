Team Firetruck: Roles, First and Last Names


**PM:** Noah Moring

**DEVELOPER:** Izge Bayyurt

**DEVELOPER:** Liam Hillery

**DESIGNER:** Aiden McGlauflin


## About Roles

- **Project Manager (PM):** makes the agenda for weekly meetings, inspires the team, offers advice, promotes fair play, evaluates teamwork, and monitors work on assignments but does not micromanage.

- **Developer:** develops the software, verifies that implementations meet requirements, takes the lead in learning relevant technical skills, and ensures the team learns them as well.

- **Designer:** envisions and prototypes the design, deepening the team's knowledge in understanding the problem that will be addressed and creating and curating visual content such as icons, images, fonts, and colors that will meet specifications.


## Team Policies

### Communication Policy
- The **@team-f** channel in the COS420 Discord server will serve as our primary form of communication. Members are expected to reply to messages as promptly as they can. There is no structured amount of time that anyone is expected to respond, as long as responses are being sent within a reasonable amount of time (less than 12 hours). The **@everyone** tag is reserved ONLY for cases where everyone's attention is truly needed. It is appropriate to use the **@mention** tag whenever necessary to get the attention of a single individual or a select few individuals. Questions, comments and concerns should be clear and directly situated for the appropriate person and it should not be confusing who the message is intended for.


### Team Meeting Schedule

- Scrum Stand Up & Sprint Kickoffs: **Mondays @ 5-6pm**
- 30 Minute Synchronous Work/Check-in: **Fridays @ 5:30-6pm**
- Ending Sprint Review: **Sundays @ 1-2pm**


## Problem Statement

Statement 1:

- Remembering tasks/appointments can be difficult for busy people
- People forget things when theyâ€™re not tracked in an organized way
- Some people keep track of their tasks in a physical journal or planner
- It can be difficult to stay organized within a planner and it would be easier to track stuff via a phone or laptop
- How can we provide an environment for people to organize their days?


Statement 2:

In text-based communication, it is often difficult to understand the emotions of the person sending the message, leading to frequent misinterpretation. When emotions are misunderstood, it can cause confusion, frustration, or even damage relationships. Accurately conveying emotion fosters better communication and understanding between individuals. Some platforms attempt to address this issue with shorthand tone indicators, such as "/s" for sarcasm or "/j" for joking, but these are often unclear to readers or inconsistently used and remembered due to lack of standardization across platforms. For example, a sender might use "/s" in one context, but the recipient may be unfamiliar with the notation, leading to miscommunication. Additionally, questions arise of how to improve emotional clarity. How can senders better express their emotions online, particularly in text-based formats? How can platforms facilitate clearer emotional understanding to prevent miscommunication and enhance the quality of conversations?
