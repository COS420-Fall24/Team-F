## Roles and Team Members

Team Firetruck: Roles, First and Last Names

**PM:** Noah Moring

**DEVELOPER:** Izge Bayyurt

**DEVELOPER:** Liam Hillery

**DEVELOPER:** Bryan Sturdivant

**DESIGNER:** Aiden McGlauflin

## About Roles

-   **Project Manager (PM):** makes the agenda for weekly meetings, inspires the team, offers advice, promotes fair play, evaluates teamwork, and monitors work on assignments but does not micromanage.

-   **Developer:** develops the software, verifies that implementations meet requirements, takes the lead in learning relevant technical skills, and ensures the team learns them as well.

-   **Designer:** envisions and prototypes the design, deepening the team's knowledge in understanding the problem that will be addressed and creating and curating visual content such as icons, images, fonts, and colors that will meet specifications.

## Team Policies

### Communication Policy

-   The **@team-f** channel in the COS420 Discord server will serve as our primary form of communication. Members are expected to reply to messages as promptly as they can. There is no structured amount of time that anyone is expected to respond, as long as responses are being sent within a reasonable amount of time (less than 12 hours). The **@everyone** tag is reserved ONLY for cases where everyone's attention is truly needed. It is appropriate to use the **@mention** tag whenever necessary to get the attention of a single individual or a select few individuals. Questions, comments and concerns should be clear and directly situated for the appropriate person and it should not be confusing who the message is intended for.

### Quality Checking Policy

-   The team will assign quality checking roles at the beginning of a sprint. Members that are working on similar features, documents, or other tasks will quality check for each other. Quality checking can be self assigned or appointed by other members. However, no one single member should handle a majority of the quality checking. To ensure that everything can be quality checked in an appropriate time, quality checking should be assigned evenly across the team. When something has been quality checked and determined to pass the quality check, it should be moved from the "Quality Checking" tab of the Kanban to the "Done" tab. This can be done by changing the status of the task.

### Team Meeting Schedule

-   Scrum Stand Up & Sprint Kickoffs: **Mondays @ 5-6pm**
-   30 Minute Synchronous Work/Check-in: **Fridays @ 5:30-6pm**
-   Ending Sprint Review: **Sundays @ 1-2pm**

## Problem Statement

In text-based communication, it is often difficult to understand the emotions of the person sending the message, leading to frequent misinterpretation. When emotions are misunderstood, it can cause confusion, frustration, or even damage relationships. Accurately conveying emotion fosters better communication and understanding between individuals. Some platforms attempt to address this issue with shorthand tone indicators, such as "/s" for sarcasm or "/j" for joking, but these are often unclear to readers or inconsistently used and remembered due to lack of standardization across platforms. For example, a sender might use "/s" in one context, but the recipient may be unfamiliar with the notation, leading to miscommunication. Additionally, questions arise of how to improve emotional clarity. How can senders better express their emotions online, particularly in text-based formats? How can platforms facilitate clearer emotional understanding to prevent miscommunication and enhance the quality of conversations?

## React App Information

(Past this point is the default React README)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
